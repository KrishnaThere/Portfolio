        Hi! I’m Krishna. Thank you for visiting my site and exploring my work.<br><br>

I'm a girl from Gujarat, India, with a dream to embrace everything life has to offer. In my early high school years, I was on a clear path toward engineering, but the artist within me eventually took the lead. My dad’s transfer to the United States became a blessing in disguise, guiding me to one of the most celebrated design schools—Parsons School of Design.<br><br>

Parsons has molded me into a very confident designer by exposing me to the vibrant New York City and extremely tallented and inspiring artists from every part of the globe to collaborte with. Being part of a global design community has offered me invaluable opportunities to collaborate with diverse minds and explore multiple perspectives and ideologies, profoundly enriching both my work and my personal growth.<br><br>

I have a bunch of hobbies; the list includes but is not limited to: solving sudoku, hicking, dancing(also am really good at it), music(can't play any instruments or sing just have love for it), painting and many more.<br><br>

To me, design is about more than just presenting complex concepts in a simplified and accessible way. It's about creating experiences that evoke strong, lasting emotions and provoke thought, leaving a meaningful impact on those who engage with it.
